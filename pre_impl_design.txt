Units/Modules and Responsibilities
==================================
Main:
  - Be the entrance point.
  - Read command line options.
  - Build a configuration object through Config's interface.
  - Build a file name list.
  - Load all images into SDL_Surface* using SDL2_image.
  - Run the algorithm to produce a final SDL_Surface* image and regions
  information through Packer's interface.
  - Output the final SDL_Surface* into a BMP.
  - Output the final regions information into a CSV through
  RegionsInfoCSVOutput's interface.

Packer:
  - Implements the algorithm which packs the several SDL_Surface* into a single
  one (produces both the final SDL_Surface* and the regions information).

Config:
  - Provide an interface to the runtime configuration of the program
  (controlled by command line options and default values).
  - Defines the data type for configuration information.

RegionsInfo:
  - Defines the data type for regions information.

RegionsInfoCSVOutput:
  - Implement the algorithm which outputs into a SDL RWOps the CSV content
  given the regions information.
